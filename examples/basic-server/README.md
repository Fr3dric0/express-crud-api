Basic-server
============

A simple example-code of how to use the `express-crud-api`.
The project was first auto-generated by `express-generated`. However
Most of the boilerplate-code is removed, as it weren't
necessary (_You must self decide what to keep_).

The files we kept were `bin/www` and `app.js`.
Most of the lines in `app.js` were also removed, like `favicon-server`.
